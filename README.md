# Chrome-s-Dinosaur-Game-using-Computer-Vision
We are basically going to play the Chrome Dinosaur game using hand movements, the game has two basic moves (up and down), which are going to be replicated by the hand moving up and down.

### How did I do it?
- Open up the camera and draw a rectangle
- Blur the image and convert it into HSV
- Erode, Dilate and Threshold
- Contour 
- Run the code and play!
